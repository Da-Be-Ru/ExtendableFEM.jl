## Meshes and FESpaces

To solve a ProblemDescription the user needs to provide some discretisation information.
The most important one is the mesh (that should be conforming with the region information used in the problem description).

Meshes are expected in the form of an ExtendableGrid, see [ExtendableGrids.jl](https://github.com/j-fu/ExtendableGrids.jl) for details and constructors.
Grid generators for simplex grids can be found e.g. in the external module [SimplexGridFactory.jl](https://github.com/j-fu/SimplexGridFactory.jl).
There is also an extension to read meshes from gmsh files.

Secondly, the user needs to decide how to discretize the unknowns by providing FESpaces for each unknown, which can be
easily generated by FESpace{FEType}(grid::ExtendableGrid) where FEType denotes the type of finite element.
A list of available FEType can be found in the documentation of ExtendableFEMBase.

## Solve (stationary)
If solve is applied to a PDEDescription and an array of FESpaces (that specify the ansatz spaces for the unknowns) an investigation of the PDEDescription is performed that decides if the problem is nonlinear (and has to be solved by a fixed-point algorithm) or if it can be solved directly in one step.

work in progress

## Export and Postprocessing

Some tools for postprocessing are discussed in a separate section.

[ExtendableGrids.jl](https://github.com/j-fu/ExtendableGrids.jl) offers an interface
to [WriteVTK.jl](https://github.com/jipolanco/WriteVTK.jl) which can be used, e.g.
in combination with nodevalues interpolations or (piecewise constant) item integrator results.
