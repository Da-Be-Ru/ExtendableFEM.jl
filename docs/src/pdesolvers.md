## Meshes and FESpaces

To solve a ProblemDescription the user needs to provide some discretisation information.
The most important one is the mesh (that should be conforming with the region information used in the problem description).

Meshes are expected in the form of an ExtendableGrid, see [ExtendableGrids.jl](https://github.com/j-fu/ExtendableGrids.jl) for details and constructors.
Grid generators for simplex grids can be found e.g. in the external module [SimplexGridFactory.jl](https://github.com/j-fu/SimplexGridFactory.jl).
There is also an extension to read meshes from gmsh files.

Secondly, the user needs to decide how to discretize the unknowns by providing FESpaces for each unknown, which can be
easily generated by FESpace{FEType}(grid::ExtendableGrid) where FEType denotes the type of finite element.
A list of available FEType can be found in the documentation of ExtendableFEMBase.

## Solve (stationary)
If solve is applied to a PDEDescription and an array of FESpaces (that specify the ansatz spaces for the unknowns) an investigation of the PDEDescription is performed that decides if the problem is nonlinear (and has to be solved by a fixed-point algorithm) or if it can be solved directly in one step. The solver attempts to bring the (nonlinear) residual to the prescribed target tolerance. In a time-dependent context this
is equivalent to seek a stationary solution and probably is not always what one wants.

## Solve (time-dependent)

For time-dependent (non-stationary) problems the user currently has these options:

- add a pre-defined time derivative operator (i.e. BackwardDifference) and iterate the problem yourself
- add custom time derivatives to the problem (i.e. a mass matrix as a BilinearOperator and necessary LinearOperators for evaluating the previous time step(s), if more than one previous time step needs to be remembered, further unknowns must be registered)
- reframe the ProblemDescription as an ODE problem and evolve it via DifferentialEquations
